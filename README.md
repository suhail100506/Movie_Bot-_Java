Movie_Bot_Java

Design and develop a movie recommendation system in Python that allows users to discover movies based on their preferences such as genre, language, actor, or ratings. The system should analyze user inputs using recommendation algorithms (content-based, collaborative, or hybrid filtering) and suggest personalized movies. Importantly, it must provide only legal streaming or download links from authorized platforms like YouTube official channels, Internet Archive, Tubi, or legitimate OTT services.

Functional Requirements
1. User Interaction
        ->Allow users to input preferences or search queries.
        ->Support user registration and login to personalize recommendations.

2. Data Management
        ->Use open and legal movie datasets.
        ->Store user preferences, ratings, and history securely.

3. Recommendation Engine
        ->Implement collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid recommendation algorithms.
        ->Generate personalized movie lists based on the analysis of user data.

4. Legal Movie Access
        ->Provide metadata with title, cast, genre, rating, and year.
        ->Display only legal streaming/download sources for movies.

5. System Interface
        ->Create a user-friendly interface to display recommendations and links.

Non-Functional Requirements
        ->Ensure ethical compliance by avoiding illegal sources.
        ->Use scalable and maintainable architecture design.
        ->Optimize recommendation accuracy and relevance.
        ->Provide clear documentation and test cases.

Deliverables
        ->Source code with documentation.
        ->Design diagrams (system architecture, database schema).
        ->Demo of user interaction and movie recommendations with legal access links.
        ->Report explaining algorithms, data sources, and ethical considerations.

Optional Enhancements
        ->Incorporate sentiment analysis from user reviews to refine recommendations.
        ->Implement user feedback mechanisms to improve recommendations over time.
        ->Enable offline download options where legally supported by platforms.
